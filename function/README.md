# Python Function Examples: From Basic to Advanced

This directory contains `function_examples.py`, a script that demonstrates a wide range of function concepts in Python. The examples are arranged from basic to advanced to help you build your understanding progressively.

---

### Part 1: The Basics

These examples cover the fundamental building blocks of Python functions.

1.  **Basic Function:** Learn how to define the simplest possible function that takes no inputs and performs a single action.

2.  **Function with Parameters:** See how to pass data into a function to make it more dynamic and reusable.

3.  **Function with Return Value:** Understand how to make a function produce an output that can be stored in a variable or used by other parts of your program.

---

### Part 2: Intermediate Concepts - Flexible Arguments

Explore more flexible ways to define and call functions.

4.  **Function with Default Parameter Value:** Discover how to make function arguments optional by providing them with a default value.

5.  **Function with Arbitrary Positional Arguments (`*args`):** Learn how to create functions that can accept any number of positional arguments.

6.  **Function with Arbitrary Keyword Arguments (`**kwargs`):** Learn to write functions that can handle any number of named arguments, which provides ultimate flexibility.

### Part 3: Advanced Concepts

Dive into more specialized and powerful function types.

7.  **Lambda Function:** Explore "anonymous" one-liner functions that are useful for short, simple operations.

8.  **Recursive Function:** Understand the concept of a function that calls itself, a powerful technique for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems.
