# Python Basic Scripts

This repository contains a collection of basic Python scripts that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts. Each script is a standalone example that can be run and studied individually.

## Files

Here is a list of the Python files in this project and a brief description of what they demonstrate:

- `variables.py`: How to declare and use variables of different data types (string, integer, float, boolean).
- `typecasting.py`: How to convert variables from one data type to another.
- `input.py`: How to take input from the user.
- `operators.py`: Different types of operators in Python (arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, identity, membership, and ternary).
- `ascii.py`: How to get the ASCII value of a character and vice-versa.
- `ifelse.py`: Conditional statements using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- `ternary.py`: How to use the ternary operator for concise conditional expressions.
- `forloop.py`: How to use `for` loops to iterate over a sequence.
- `whileloop.py`: How to use `while` loops for repeated execution of a block of code.
- `calculator.py`: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.
- `pattern.py`: How to print different patterns using nested loops.
- `app.py`: A simple "Hello World" program.

## How to Run

To run any of the scripts, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and use the `python` command followed by the script name. For example:

```bash
python forloop.py
```
